# HARVARD UNIVERSITY CS50 provided by EdX
Harvard University’s CS50 x 2024 course teaches how to solve problems, both with and without code, with an emphasis on correctness, design, and style. Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science. The course begins with the traditional language called C, to learn about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and also about how computers work. The course then transitions to Python. Finally, toward term’s end, the course introduces SQL along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The course culminates in a final project.


## Objective

The primary reason this course is being completed is to deepen my understanding of programming languages. Several SIEMs and SOARs utilize automation to improve cybersecurity measures. As a cybersecurity professional understanding Python would increase my effectiveness and efficiency within a SIEM system. 

### Skills Learned

- Programming with C
- Arrays, Algorithms, Memory and Data Structures
- Programming with Python
- Artificial Intelligence
- SQL
- HTML, CSS and Javascript
- Flask

### Tools Used
